## Build Instructions
1. Run `make` to build the graphics engine and parser. Optionally, run `make fast` to compile with additional optimizations. To enable debugging features, uncomment the two lines in the `Makefile` that initialize the `DEBUG` and `BISON_DEBUG` variables.  

## Usage
1. To run the graphics engine on an mdl script, run: `./mdl <script>`
